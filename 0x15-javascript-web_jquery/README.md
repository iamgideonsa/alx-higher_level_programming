# `0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery`

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn:
* Why JQuery makes front-end programming so easy (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #ilovejquery :))
* How to select HTML elements in JavaScript
* How to select HTML elements with JQuery
* What are the differences between `ID`, `class`, and `tag name` selectors
* How to modify an HTML element style
* How to get and update an HTML element content
* How to modify the DOM
* How to make a `GET` request with JQuery Ajax
* How to make a `POST` request with JQuery Ajax
* How to listen/bind to DOM events

## `Tech`
### `General`
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are interpreted on Chrome (version 57.0)
* All files end with a new line
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes are `semistandard` compliant with the flag `--global $`: `semistandard *.js --global $`
* Used JQuery version 3.x
* `var` was not used
* No HTML reload for each action: DOM manipulation, update values, fetch data…
