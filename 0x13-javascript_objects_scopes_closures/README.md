# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn:
* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to create an object in JavaScript
* What `this` means
* What `undefined` means
* Why the variable type and scope are important
* What is a closure
* What is a prototype and
* How to inherit an object from another

## Requirements
### General
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `node` (version 14.x)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* All codes are `semistandard` compliant (version 16.x.x). `Rules of Standard` + `semicolons on top`.
* All files are executable
* Length of files is tested using `wc`
* `var` was not used.
