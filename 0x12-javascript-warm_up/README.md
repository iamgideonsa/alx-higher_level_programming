# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to know how to use **Javascript** for Scripting and web front-end.

## Requirements
### General
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `node` (version 14.x)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* All codes are `semistandard` compliant (version 16.x.x). `Rules of Standard` + `semicolons on top`.
* All files are executable
* Length of files is tested using `wc`
