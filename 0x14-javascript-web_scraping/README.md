# `0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping`

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn:
* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to manipulate JSON data
* How to use `request` and fetch API
* How to read and write a file using `fs` module

## `Tech`
### `General`
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `node` (version 14.x)
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* Codes are `semistandard` compliant. `Rules of Standard` + `semicolons on top`. Also as reference: `AirBnB style`
* All files are executable
* Length of files is tested using `wc`
* `var` was not used
