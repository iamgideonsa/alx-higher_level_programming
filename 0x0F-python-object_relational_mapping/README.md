# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn how to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script, what ORM means and how to map a Python Class to a MySQL table.

## Tech
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
* All files are executed with `MySQLdb` version `2.0.x`
* All files are executed with `SQLAlchemy` version `1.4.x`
* All files end with a new line
* The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* All codes use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All files are executable
* Length of files is tested using `wc`
* All modules have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All classes have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All functions (inside and outside a class) have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* The length of documentation is verified
* No `execute` with sqlalchemy
