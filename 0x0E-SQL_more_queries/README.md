# 0x0E. SQL - More queries

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn about how to create a new user, manage privileges for a user, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, constraints, subqueries, `JOIN` and `UNION` with **MySQL**.

## Requirements
### General
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS `MySQL 8.0` (version 8.0.25)
* All files end with a new line
* All SQL queries have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
* All files start by a comment describing the task
* All SQL keywords are in uppercase (`SELECT`, `WHERE`â€¦)
* A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project
* The length of all files is tested using `wc`
